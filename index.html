<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This study presents the Hellenic Extreme Weather Database of high-impact weather events that occurred in Greece in the period 2010-2018 (9 years).
The selected events are related to the occurrence of meteorological (tornadic events, lightinigs, hailstorms) and hydrological (flash floods) events with adverse socio-economic consequences.
The database includes, among others, the geographical location of the recorded events, the date and a brief description of the induced impacts.
Below we will analyze the selected phenomena and see a few time animations. </p>

		<h3>Flash Floods</h3>
		<p>Flash floods are called floods where they break out suddenly and are the result of heavy rainfall, extreme storms, siphons or even glacier melting water.
			Floods result in the loss of human lives, destruction of buildings and structures, road network, sewerage systems and electricity transmission networks. The destruction of these infrastructures can lead to disruption of drinking water supply, transport and communication difficulties, the occurrence of diseases related to drinking water quality and difficulties in healthcare.</p>
		<p>Flash floods mainly occur during the autumn period, and they occur mainly along coastal regions and in close proximity of large city centres.A special factor that is related to the spatial allocation of flash floods is urban sprawl. 
			High density residential development increases the number of individuals and properties at risk.</p>
