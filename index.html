<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Extreme weather phenomena (such as tornadoes, waterspouts, lightnings, hails, storms) are a major threat to public health, causing material damage, injuries, and even deaths. Often the extreme weather phenomena interact and produce a complex process. Over the last decades weather-related disasters have attracted the scientific interest due to their significant socioeconomic impact. In addition, recent scientific papers show that climate change will affect the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. A possible increase in extreme effects and negative impacts requires a systematic inventory and monitoring of the phenomena, both to mitigate these impacts and to develop appropriate risk and disaster management tools and models. 
Greece experiences a variety of extreme weather phenomena, often followed by negative impacts on socio-economic activity. However, the study focuses mainly on certain areas of the country, and on particular weather phenomena.

Below we will analyze the selected phenomena and see a few time animations, but first we will see the seasonal variability of the phenomena and 
	a timeline event.</p>

		<h3>Seasonal variability of extreme events</h3>
		<p>The findings of the weather events revealed a specific spatial and seasonal distribution over Greece, within the 2010-2018 period. 
		      The following figure, summarises these findings with extreme weather events during each season.</p>

		    	<h5>Seasonal variability of severe weather phenomena over Greece 2010-2018</h5>
			</div>
	<p>The largest number of extreme weather events was recorded during autumn (258), followed by summer (191), winter (165) and spring (149).
		The seasonal variability of lightning events over Greece shows that autumn and summer seasons are the more prominent for lightning activity. Autumn is characterized as the most active cyclone season, 
		as low pressure systems over the west Greece are interacting with the warm sea body of the Ionian Sea, producing unstable weather conditions that propagate eastward over the Aegean Sea. 
		During summer season lightning activity is related to unstable weather conditions due to thermal convection over the mainland Greece as thunderstorms are of continental origin.
		These unstable conditions appear during the warmest hours of the day. </p>

		<h3>Flash Floods</h3>
		<p>Flash floods are break out suddenly and are the result of heavy rainfall, extreme storms, siphons or even glacier melting water.
			Floods result in the loss of human lives, destruction of buildings and structures, road network, sewerage systems and electricity transmission networks. The destruction of these infrastructures can lead to disruption of drinking water supply, transport and communication difficulties, the occurrence of diseases related to drinking water quality and difficulties in healthcare.</p>
		<p>Flash floods mainly occur during the autumn period, and they occur mainly along coastal regions and in close proximity of large city centres. 
			High density residential development increases the number of individuals and properties at risk. Below we can see recorded Flash Floods events from 2010-2018.</p>

			</div>
 
		<p> The Following Heatmap shows that they occur mainly along coastal regions and in close proximity of large city centres (Athens, Korinthos, Chania, Volos etc...). 
		 A special factor that is related to the spatial allocation of flash floods is urban sprawl. High density residential development increases the number of individuals and properties at risk.</p>

		<h3>Tornadic Events</h3>
		<p>Tornado is a rapidly rotating windmill that is in contact with both the ground and the base of boulders. Pitch spiders are a category of clouds with very high vertical growth, and are associated with severe weather phenomena.
	Droplets are rotated at speeds of 30 m /s. up to 135 m / s. while their diameter does not exceed 2 km.  They can have several shapes, but their classical appearance is the elephant provocase that escapes from the base of the pits.Below we can see recorded Tornadic events from 2010-2018</p>

		<p> The Following Heatmap shows the spatial variability of tornadic events over Greece.Western Greece, the area of Crete and Rhodes, as well as Attica, are the regions were we observe the highest concentration of these phenomena.</p>

		<h3>Lightnings</h3>
		<p>Thunderbolts are atmospheric electricity evacuation accompanied by thunder, and is considered to be one of the most powerful and impressive phenomena that occur in the atmosphere. 
			These cloud discharges can be Cloud to Cloud-CtC, Cloud to Air CtA, or Cloud to Ground-CtG.They have a particular place in the scientific literature as they can cause deaths, injuries and damage.Below we can see recorded lightning events that caused any
			form of damage or death from 2010-2018</p>

		<p> Lightning storms are mainly distributed in the western and eastern parts of mainland Greece as it was supported by previous studies. Fewer cases were recorded in the islands.</p>

		<h3>Hailstorms</h3>
		<p>Hail is a form of slush, consisting of pieces of ice, pellets or other shapes, called hazelnuts and falling during storms.
                Any storm accompanied by hail that reaches the ground is termed as hailstorm.Below we can see recorded Hailstorm events from 2010-2018</p>

		<p> Maximum numbers of hailstorms (Figure 4c) are clustered in mainland Greece, mainly in the western and central parts of the country, as well as in the capital area.</p>

		<h3>Wind Gusts</h3>
		<p>Wind gust is called a high speed wind gust where its maximum speed exceeds the minimum of 19 km / h. Wind gusts do not last long (from a few seconds to a few minutes) but cause damage to roofs, tree collapses, etc. and can cause even loss of life.Below we can see recorded Flash Floods events from 2010-2018 </p>
