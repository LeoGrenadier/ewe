<h1>Extreme Weather Phemomena in Greece (2010-2018)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This study presents the Hellenic Extreme Weather Database of high-impact weather events that occurred in Greece in the period 2010-2018 (9 years).
The selected events are related to the occurrence of meteorological (tornadic events, lightinigs, hailstorms) and hydrological (flash floods) events with adverse socio-economic consequences.
The database includes, among others, the geographical location of the recorded events, the date and a brief description of the induced impacts.
Below we will analyze the selected phenomena and see a few time animations. </p>

		<h3>Flash Floods</h3>
		<p>Flash floods are called floods where they break out suddenly and are the result of heavy rainfall, extreme storms, siphons or even glacier melting water.
			Floods result in the loss of human lives, destruction of buildings and structures, road network, sewerage systems and electricity transmission networks. The destruction of these infrastructures can lead to disruption of drinking water supply, transport and communication difficulties, the occurrence of diseases related to drinking water quality and difficulties in healthcare.</p>
		<p>Flash floods mainly occur during the autumn period, and they occur mainly along coastal regions and in close proximity of large city centres.A special factor that is related to the spatial allocation of flash floods is urban sprawl. 
			High density residential development increases the number of individuals and properties at risk.</p>

		<h3>Tornadic Events</h3>
		<p>Tornado is a rapidly rotating windmill that is in contact with both the ground and the base of boulders. Pitch spiders are a category of clouds with very high vertical growth, and are associated with severe weather phenomena.
	Droplets are rotated at speeds of 30 m /s. up to 135 m / s. while their diameter does not exceed 2 km.  They can have several shapes, but their classical appearance is the elephant provocase that escapes from the base of the pits.</p>

		<h3>Lightnings</h3>
		<p>Thunderbolts are atmospheric electricity evacuation accompanied by thunder, and is considered to be one of the most powerful and impressive phenomena that occur in the atmosphere. 
			These cloud discharges can be Cloud to Cloud-CtC, Cloud to Air CtA, or Cloud to Ground-CtG.They have a particular place in the scientific literature as they can cause deaths, injuries and damage.</p>

		<h3>Hailstorms</h3>
		<p>Hail is a form of slush, consisting of pieces of ice, pellets or other shapes, called hazelnuts and falling during storms, from large

stormy clouds. Any storm accompanied by hail that reaches the ground is termed as hailstorm.</p>

		<h3>Wind Gusts</h3>
		<p>Wind gust is called a high speed wind gust where its maximum speed exceeds the minimum of 19 km / h. Wind gusts do not last long (from a few seconds to a few minutes) but cause damage to roofs, tree collapses, etc. and can cause even loss of life.</p>
